   and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series.  It
   captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance
   regarding the style and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is
   captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that
   guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style Guide.

1.  Introduction

   As colonization of mars gets closer, there are still some problems 
   that must be solved before a such plan can happen.  Currently NASA
   has a long-term goal of sending humans to Mars by 2030s [1], so there
   is not much time to loose.

   One of the problems is how to use TCP/IP protocol as a means of
   communications.  The problem is that if a packet gets lost into the
   space, the time cost of resending the packet from Mars (or Earth) is 
   way too long, making the communications with really difficult between
   the planets.

   Our solution to this problem is setting up a relay link system
   between the planets, using satellites strategically positioned to the
   lagrangian points and to the orbit of the Sun, Earth and Mars.  The
   relay links will have some memory, which will be used to store TCP/IP
   packets.  This way, if a packet goes missing on its way to Earth
   or Mars, it can be resent from the relay satellite, instead of
   sending it from its origin planet, which will cause huge latency.

   The above solution will be discussed in more detail in the second
   chapter.  In the third chapter, we will discuss about data integrity
   and in the fourth chapter we will briefly discuss security problems.
   Fifth chapter will have quick summary about this paper.

2. The Latency Problem

   As both Earth and Mars occupy their own respective orbits of the Sun,
   the distance between the two planets is by no means constant. The
   theoretical minimum of the interplanetary distance is as little as 56
   million kilometers, with the theoretical maximum being as large as
   401 million km - over 7.3 times the minimum distance.  This means,
   that when using a lightspeed physical layer in Earth-Mars
   communications, the transmission delay varies from roughly 3 minutes
   to 22 minutes.  On average, the interplanetary distance is 225
   million km - causing an average delay of 13 minutes. [2]

   While obviously an inconvenience in itself, the transmission delay
   is not a problem that can be solved with our current understanding of
   physics.  Instead the problem that this document proposes a
   mitigation to is the overall latency realized as packets are lost and
   retransmitted - the retransmission of a single package at the
   worst-case scenario (that is the theoretical maximum inter-planetary
   distance) would cause an overall latency of some 45 minutes.

2.1 Satellite Relays

   Our proposed solution to the latency issue is setting up a relay link
   system to the space, which would would relay the packets between the 
   planets.  When a connection from Earth to Mars (or vice versa) is 
   established, every link will open their own TCP session to the link
   next to them.  The link relay satellities must have enough memory and
   logic so that they are able to create these sessions between them.

   The motivation behind this satellite relay solution is to split the
   total travelling distance to smaller chunks.  The relays should use
   some kind of algorithm to determine the best link relays for the
   whole path at the current situation.  If the planets are close to 
   each other, there should be less links than for example when the 
   planets are furthest away from each other.

   Now if a packet goes missing, noticing it will be much quicker,
   because of the TCP sessions between the links.  The links will store
   all packets that they receive for transmitting, and if a packet goes
   missing they will simply retransmit it until they receive ACK from
   the next relay.  At this point, the packet may be removed from the
   links memory.


2.2 Satellite Constellation

   We propose that the satellite link relays will be placed to the
   Langrarian points of both Earth and Mars.  In addition, there should
   be some edge relays placed in the orbits of the said planets.  By
   placing the satellite link relays to Lagrangian points, we can make 
   sure that the Sun will never be able to block the communications 
   between the planets completly.

   Further research to optimize the satellite locations should be made.

3. Data Integrity vs. Bandwidth                             

                             RFC Style Guide                    May 2020
   This document will not go into the actual technological components of
   interplanetary receiver/transmitter implementations, however it is
   important to know the main points to consider when making
   compromises between data transfer speed and sacrificing channel
   capacity for forward error correction purposes.

   The main difference between relevant resources on Earth and
   interplanetary communication is that massive latency is usually
   an issue on Earth, while due to regulatory reasons, bandwidth is much
   more of a scarce resource. The opposite could be said about
   planet-to-planet communications; while there is a lot of bandwidth
   available (for now), the latency, more specifically the
   multiplied latency in case of packet loss, is a major factor to
   consider.

   Taking these resource factors into account, development should
   prioritize data intergrity over transfer speed.  However, similar to
   terrestrial wireless communications, different channel codings should
   be developed to provide varying goodput values, as the channel will
   without doubt vary over time, as the interplanetary distance changes,
   along with the strength of solar noise.
