Abstract

   This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions
   and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series.  It
   captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance
   regarding the style and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is
   captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that
   guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style Guide.
   This document obsoletes RFC 2223, "Instructions to RFC Authors".

1.  Introduction

   As colonization of mars gets closer, there are still some problems 
   that must be solved before a such plan can happen.  Currently NASA
   has a long-term goal of sending humans to Mars by 2030s [1], so there
   is not much time to loose.

   One of the problems is how to use TCP/IP protocol as a means of
   communications.  The problem is that if a packet gets lost into the
   space, the time cost of resending the packet from Mars is way too
   long, making the communications with really difficult between the
   planets.

   Our solution to this problem is setting up a relay link system
   between the planets, using satellites strategically positioned to the
   lagrangian points and to the orbit of the Sun, Earth and Mars.  The
   relay links will have some memory, which will be used to store TCP/IP
   packets.  This way, if a packet goes missing on its way to Earth
   or Mars, it can be resent from the relay satellite, instead of
   sending it from its origin planet, which will cause huge latency.

   The above solution will be discussed in more detail in the second
   chapter.  In the third chapter, we will discuss about data integrity
   and in the fourth chapter we will briefly discuss security problems.
   Fifth chapter will have quick summary about this paper.

2. The Latency Problem
                             
                              Proposal                          [Page 4]
   As both Earth and Mars occupy their own respective orbits of the Sun,
   the distance between the two planets is by no means constant. The
   theoretical minimum of the interplanetary distance is as little as 56
   million kilometers, with the theoretical maximum being as large as
   401 million km - over 7.3 times the minimum distance.  This means,
   that when using RF as the physical layer in Earth-Mars
   communications, the transmit delay varies from roughly 3 minutes to
   22 minutes.  On average, the interplanetary distance is 225 million
   km - causing an average delay of 13 minutes.

   While obviously an inconvenience in itself, the transmission delay
   is not a problem that can be solved with our current understanding of
   physics.  Instead the problem that this document proposes a
   mitigation to is the overall latency realized as packets are lost and
   retransmitted - the retransmit of a single package at the worst-case
   scenario (that is the theoretical maximum interplanetary distance)
   would cause an overall latency of some 45 minutes.
