Abstract

   This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions
   and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series.  It
   captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance
   regarding the style and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is
   captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that
   guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style Guide.
   This document obsoletes RFC 2223, "Instructions to RFC Authors".

1.  Introduction

   As colonization of mars gets closer, there are still some problems 
   that must be solved before a such plan can happen.  Currently NASA
   has a long-term goal of sending humans to Mars by 2030s [1], so there
   is not much time to loose.

   One of the problems is how to use TCP/IP protocol as a means of
   communications.  The problem is that if a packet gets lost into the
   space, the time cost of resending the packet from Mars is way too
   long, making the communications with really difficult between the
   planets.

   Our solution to this problem is setting up a relay link system
   between the planets, using satellites strategically positioned to the
   lagrangian points and to the orbit of the Sun, Earth and Mars.  The
   relay links will have some memory, which will be used to store TCP/IP
   packets.  This way, if a packet goes missing on its way to Earth
   or Mars, it can be resent from the relay satellite, instead of
   sending it from its origin planet, which will cause huge latency.

   The above solution will be discussed in more detail in the second
   chapter.  In the third chapter, we will discuss about data integrity
   and in the fourth chapter we will briefly discuss security problems.
   Fifth chapter will have quick summary about this paper.
